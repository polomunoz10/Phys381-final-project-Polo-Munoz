# Phys381-final-project-Polo-Munoz
This project investigates whether Ferrari may have had an engine performance advantage by potentially bypassing fuel flow regulations â€” a controversy that arose during the 2019 Formula 1 season. Using telemetry data accessed through the FastF1 Python library, the analysis focuses on:
- Acceleration and speed profiles  
- Braking and throttle traces  
- Kinematic comparisons with other teams  
- Signs of anomalous fuel delivery behavior

The goal is to determine whether on-track telemetry supports suspicions of noncompliant fuel flow manipulation.


## Files
- `temp.py`: Python script for loading, processing, and plotting telemetry data
- `figure.png`: Placeholder for output figure
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- fastf1
- matplotlib
- numpy

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install fastf1 matplotlib numpy`

2. Run the script:  
   `python temp.py
